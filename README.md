# SIBDQ to EQ-5D-5L Mapping App

This is an R Shiny application that maps SIBDQ (Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire) answers to EQ-5D-5L utility index scores, based on the methodology described in the paper "Mapping from SIBDQ to EQ-5D-5L for patients with inflammatory bowel disease" (forthcoming).

## Application Overview
